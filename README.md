# Rubrik Security Cloud Slack Connector (Azure version)

## What does it do?

This connector runs as an Azure Function and provides a webhook URL for Rubrik Security Cloud (RSC, formerly Polaris) to send alerts to. This provides simple connectivity to Slack as it sends alert information as BlockKit formatted messages into a Slack channel.

## How does it work?

Create a new webhook in the RSC "Security Settings" page (can be accessed via the gear icon in the top right hand corner) and filter out the required events and severity. For example, to send backup operations events to Slack, you may wish to select the "Backup", "Diagnostic", "Maintenance" and "System" event types with the "Critical" and "Warning" severities.

Product documentation can be found at https://docs.rubrik.com/en-us/saas/saas/common/webhooks.html.

## What do I need to get started?

- An RSC tenant (including URL, e.g. myorg.my.rubrik.com)
- A Slack account
- A Slack channel to send alerts to
- An incoming Slack webhook URL (https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
- Python 3.7/3.8/3.9 (3.10 is not currently supported by Azure Functions)
- Git
- Azure Functions command line tools
- Azure CLI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli)

## Obtaining the code

Run **git clone https://github.com/chrisbeckett/rbk-slack-connector.git**

## Deploying the Azure Function

Click the "Deploy to Azure" button (right click and "open in a new tab" is recommended) and fill out the deployment form

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%MStenke%2Frbk-slack-webhook%2Fmain%2Fdeployment-template.json)


- Both the **Azure Function** name and the **Storage Account** name **must be globally unique or deployment will fail (if a new storage account is created)**
- Once the ARM template deployment is complete, open a command prompt and navigate to the **rbk-slack-connector** folder
- **Tip** To avoid potential deployment issues, it is recommended to pin the Python version in the Function to the version you have installed locally on your staging machine. To do this, run this command from a command prompt - **az functionapp config set --name function-name --resource-group resourcegroupname --linux-fx-version "Python|3.9"** (change the function name, resource group and Python version as appropriate)
- Install the Azure Functions command line tools (*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash*)
- Run **func init**
- Run **func azure functionapp publish _functname_** where the functname is your function name from the "**Deploy to Azure**" workflow
- When this is complete, you will need the HTTP trigger URL (Function overview, "Get Function URL" button)
- Add a webhook record in Rubrik Security Cloud using the Function URL obtained in the previous step
